## 1. The Core Workflow

Lumina-Wiki operates on a simple principle: separate your raw materials from the AI's structured knowledge.

```text
+-------------------------+      /lumi-ingest      +---------------------------+
|      YOUR INPUT         | ---------------------> |     THE AGENT'S BRAIN     |
|       (raw/ folder)     |                        |       (wiki/ folder)      |
|                         | <--------------------- |                           |
|  - my-paper.pdf         |       /lumi-ask        |  - my-paper.md (summary)  |
|  - my-notes.txt         |                        |  - concept-a.md           |
+-------------------------+                        +---------------------------+
```

1.  **You Provide:** Place your documents (PDFs, notes) into the `raw/` directory.
2.  **The Agent Builds:** Use commands in your AI chat (like `/lumi-ingest`) to make the agent read from `raw/` and build a structured, interlinked wiki in the `wiki/` directory.
3.  **You Query:** Ask questions (using `/lumi-ask`) against the agent's "brain" in `wiki/`, receiving faster and more context-aware answers.

## 2. Getting Started

### **Step 1: Install**
Install the wiki workspace into your current project with one command:

```bash
npx lumina-wiki install
```
> **Note for Windows Users:** For the best experience, it is recommended to [enable Developer Mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development) to allow the installer to use symlinks correctly. If Developer Mode is off, the installer will fall back to copying skill files, which is functional but less ideal for updates.

The installer will guide you through a quick setup, including selecting optional **Packs** like `research` and `reading`.

### **Step 2 (Optional): Configure the Research Pack**
If you installed the `research` pack, some skills need API keys to search online. Run the setup skill to configure them. In your AI chat window:

> **You:**
> `/lumi-research-setup`

The agent will guide you through an interactive setup to save your keys to a local `.env` file.

### **Step 3 (Upgrades): Migrate Legacy Wiki Entries**

If you are **re-installing Lumina-Wiki on a project that already has a `wiki/` from an earlier version**, run the installer the same way:

```bash
npx lumina-wiki install
```

The installer detects the version bump and updates scripts, schemas, and skills atomically. **Your wiki content (`wiki/`, `raw/`, `log.md`) is never modified by the installer.** When the installer finds frontmatter fields added by newer versions but missing on older entries, it prints a `[warn]` banner with the count and the next step.

You then have two ways to backfill:

**Option A — LLM-driven (recommended):** Open your AI chat and run:

> **You:**
> `/lumi-migrate-legacy`

The skill reads `_lumina/CHANGELOG.md` to learn which fields each version added, runs `lint --json` to find affected entries, and infers per-entry values (e.g. `provenance: replayable | partial | missing`, `confidence: high | medium | low | unverified`) from `raw/` snapshots, citation edges, and entry metadata. Idempotent — safe to run multiple times.

**Option B — Quick deterministic backfill:** From your terminal:

```bash
node _lumina/scripts/wiki.mjs migrate --add-defaults
```

This applies conservative defaults (`provenance: missing`, `confidence: unverified`) to every entry that lacks them. Lint goes green immediately, but values are placeholders — you can refine later with Option A or by editing entries by hand.

You can combine: run Option B first for a clean lint, then Option A when you want higher-quality values. Both write atomically and leave a trail in `wiki/log.md`.

For the full list of schema changes per version, see [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) or the local copy at `_lumina/CHANGELOG.md` after install.

## 3. Your First Commands (Core Skills)

Interact with your wiki using these commands in your AI chat interface (Gemini CLI, Claude, etc.).

**Phase 1: Ingestion & Building**
-   `/lumi-init`: Scans the `raw/` directory and performs an initial build of the wiki.
-   `/lumi-ingest [path/to/file]`: Processes a single new document and integrates it into the knowledge base.

**Phase 2: Query & Maintenance**
-   `/lumi-ask [your question]`: Asks a question against the entire knowledge base in `wiki/`.
-   `/lumi-edit [path/to/wiki/page]`: Requests a change or correction to a specific wiki page.
-   `/lumi-check`: Lints the wiki for errors (broken links, etc.).

*Additional skills may be available if you installed optional packs like `research` or `reading`.*

## 4. The Workspace Directory Guide

Lumina creates a workspace with a clear purpose for each directory.

### **Primary Folders (Your Daily Workspace)**

| Path | Purpose | Managed By |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`raw/`** | **Your Immutable Input Library.** The agent **only reads** from here. | **You** |
| `raw/sources/` | Place your primary documents (PDFs, articles) here. | You |
| `raw/notes/` | Your personal, unstructured notes and ideas. | You |
| `raw/assets/` | Images or other assets for your notes. | You |
| `raw/discovered/`| *(Research Pack)* Papers found by `/lumi-research-discover` are saved here. | Agent |
| **`wiki/`** | **The Agent's Brain.** The agent **writes** structured knowledge here. | **Agent** |
| `wiki/sources/` | AI-generated summaries for each document in `raw/sources`. | Agent |
| `wiki/concepts/` | Core ideas and definitions are extracted into individual pages. | Agent |
| `wiki/people/` | Profiles of authors, researchers, etc. | Agent |
| `wiki/outputs/` | Detailed answers from `/lumi-ask` are saved here for reference. | Agent |
| `wiki/index.md` | The main table of contents for your wiki. | Agent |
| `...` | *(Other entity folders like `foundations/`, `characters/` appear with packs)* | Agent |


### **System Folders (Managed by Lumina)**

| Path | Purpose | Managed By |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`_lumina/`** | The core engine, scripts, and configuration for the wiki. | **System** |
| **`.agents/`** | Contains all the `skills` that the agent can use. | **System** |
| `...` | *(Other dotfiles like `.claude/`, `.gitignore`)* | **System** |

**Note:** You generally do not need to modify the System Folders.

### **Browsing Your Wiki with Obsidian (Optional)**

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is the recommended visual companion for Lumina-Wiki. Because the wiki uses native Obsidian `[[wikilinks]]`, you get a full graph view, backlinks panel, and property queries out of the box.

**Point your vault at the project root** — not just the `wiki/` subfolder. The root contains `index.md`, `log.md`, and cross-links between `wiki/` pages and `raw/` source files that only resolve when Obsidian can see both directories.

**Recommended setup after `npx lumina-wiki install`:**

1. Obsidian → **Open folder as vault** → select the project root.
2. **Settings → Files & links → Excluded files** — add:
   - `_lumina/`, `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.agents/`, `.git/`, `wiki/graph/`
   - Agent entry-point stubs: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `QWEN.md` — they only redirect to `README.md` and would otherwise add empty nodes to the graph view. Keep `README.md` itself visible: it is the canonical schema reference.
3. **Settings → Files & links**:
   - Use `[[Wikilinks]]`: **on**
   - New link format: **Shortest path when possible**
   - Default attachment location: `In the folder specified below` → `raw/assets/`
4. **Core plugins to enable:** Graph view, Backlinks, Outgoing links, Tags, Properties, Outline.
5. *(Optional)* Community plugin **Dataview** — lets you query pages by frontmatter fields like `type`, `importance`, `confidence`, and `date_added`.

> The `wiki/graph/` folder contains `edges.jsonl` and `citations.jsonl` (machine-readable data files, not markdown). Excluding it keeps the graph view clean.

### **Local Search with qmd (Optional)**

As your wiki grows, you may want faster full-text search than `index.md` plus `grep` can offer. We recommend [qmd](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) — a local, on-device search engine for markdown files with hybrid BM25/vector search and LLM re-ranking. It pairs nicely with Lumina-Wiki and your AI agent.

**How to wire it into your agent:**

1. Install qmd following the instructions in its repo, then index the project root so it sees both `wiki/` and `raw/`.
2. **CLI route** — your agent can call `qmd <query>` via `Bash`. Just mention in your prompts that the command is available.
3. **MCP route (handy for Claude Code, Codex, Cursor)** — register qmd's MCP server in your IDE's MCP config. The agent picks it up as a native tool and can call it from `/lumi-ask` or any follow-up.
4. Re-index after `/lumi-ingest` (manually or via a hook) so new pages become searchable.

qmd sits alongside `index.md` and the wiki graph — a fast retrieval layer that feeds your agent better candidates before it reads pages in full.

**Bonus — tobi's official qmd skill.** tobi also publishes a dedicated skill that teaches your agent how to use qmd effectively (when to pick `lex` vs `vec` vs `hyde`, how to write `intent` to disambiguate, lex syntax for phrases and exclusions). If your IDE supports the skill format, you can install it with:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/tobi/qmd --skill qmd
```

We recommend reading [the skill page on skills.sh](https://skills.sh/tobi/qmd/qmd) first to see exactly what it adds.

## 6. What's Coming Next

The current release is **v0.2** (preview). The full plan lives in [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md). Headline items:

**v1.0.0 — First Stable**
- **Daily search & fetch** — watchlist queries (`_lumina/config/watchlist.yml`) run on a cadence; new arXiv / Semantic Scholar hits land in `raw/discovered/<date>/` automatically.
- New `/lumi-daily` skill to triage what landed since last run.
- Stability lock for the v0.1 surface (CLI flags, exit codes, schema field names).
- Cross-platform CI matrix (macOS + Linux + Windows, Node 20 + 22).

**v2.0.0 — Research Pack Source Expansion**
- **New paper sources:** OpenAlex, Unpaywall, CORE (Priority 1) → OpenReview, Hugging Face Papers, Papers With Code (Priority 2) → Crossref, DOAJ, research-blog RSS (Priority 3).
- **Paper ranking:** new `/lumi-rank` skill surfacing influential-citation count, field-normalized citation rank, Scite support/contrast tally, and Altmetric attention — all into a `ranking:` block on the paper's frontmatter.

**Want to help?** Pick any unchecked item in `ROADMAP.md`, open an issue to claim it, then send a PR. Source fetchers all follow the same pattern in `src/tools/` (CLI + JSON, no async, exit codes `0/2/3`) so they're a friendly first contribution. See the local-dev steps below.
