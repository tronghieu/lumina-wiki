**Sections:**
- `## Summary` — 2–4 sentence abstract in your own words
- `## Key claims` — bulleted list of the source's central assertions
- `## Evidence` — notable data, experiments, or arguments supporting the claims
- `## Related concepts` — wikilinks to concept pages
- `## Related sources` — wikilinks to other source pages
- `## People` — wikilinks to person pages

- `## Ranking` — *(optional; managed by `/lumi-research-rank`)* human-readable influence signals and the 4C quality scorecard (Correctness, Clarity, Contribution, Context) with one-line rationales. Each figure states its source and date. Free-text notes you add inside `<!-- user-edited -->` markers are preserved when the ranking is refreshed.
- `## Notes` — free-form notes (user-owned; mark with `<!-- user-edited -->` to preserve on upgrade)

## Reflection page — `wiki/reflections/<slug>.md` (learning pack)

Created and updated via `/lumi-learning-reflect`. AI never writes reflection content.

```yaml
---
id: reflection-<slug>
title: "My understanding of <Concept Name>"
type: reflection
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
related_concepts:
  - concept-slug
related_sources:
  - source-slug
evolution_count: 1
---
```

**Sections:**
- `## Current understanding` — **rewritable**: the user's latest thinking in their own words; AI may quote past versions to prompt reflection but never edits this section
- `## Evolution` — **append-only**: one dated entry per reflection session; never edit or delete entries

**Evolution entry format:**
```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD — <brief label>
<What you wrote or changed in this session (1–3 sentences)>
```

**Boundary rule:** Reflection pages are **personal overlay** — they reference academic pages via frontmatter only (no wikilinks that create graph edges). Do not write `[[concept-slug]]` inline body links; reference concepts only in `related_concepts:` frontmatter. No reverse link is required from concept/source pages back to reflections.
